  abstract = {Ever deeper and wider look-back surveys have led to a fairly robust outline of the cosmic star-formation history, which culminated around ; this period is often nicknamed “cosmic noon.” Our knowledge about star-forming galaxies at these epochs has dramatically advanced from increasingly complete population censuses and detailed views of individual galaxies. We highlight some of the key observational insights that influenced our current understanding of galaxy evolution in the equilibrium growth picture: ▪ Scaling relations between galaxy properties are fairly well established among massive galaxies at least out to , pointing to regulating mechanisms already acting on galaxy growth. ▪ Resolved views reveal that gravitational instabilities and efficient secular processes within the gas- and baryon-rich galaxies at play an important role in the early buildup of galactic structure. ▪ Ever more sensitive observations of kinematics at are probing the baryon and dark matter budget on galactic scales and the links between star-forming galaxies and their likely descendants. ▪ Toward higher masses, massive bulges, dense cores, and powerful AGNs and AGN-driven outflows are more prevalent and likely play a role in quenching star formation. We outline emerging questions and exciting prospects for the next decade with upcoming instrumentation, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the next generation of extremely large telescopes.},

  abstract = {A cosmologically significant population of very luminous high-redshift galaxies has recently been discovered at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths. Advances in submm detector technologies have opened this new window on the distant Universe. Here we discuss the properties of the high-redshift submm galaxies, their significance for our understanding of the process of galaxy formation, and the selection effects that apply to deep submm surveys. The submm galaxies generate a significant fraction of the energy output of all the galaxies in the early Universe. We emphasize the importance of studying a complete sample of submm galaxies, and stress that because they are typically very faint in other wavebands, these follow-up observations are very challenging. Finally, we discuss the surveys that will be made using the next generation of submm-wave instruments under development.},

  abstract = {We present a catalogue of ∼3000 submillimetre sources detected (≥3.5σ) at 850 μm over ∼5 deg2 surveyed as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS). This is the largest survey of its kind at 850 μm, increasing the sample size of 850 μm selected submillimetre galaxies by an order of magnitude. The wide 850 μm survey component of S2CLS covers the extragalactic fields: UKIDSS-UDS, COSMOS, Akari-NEP, Extended Groth Strip, Lockman Hole North, SSA22 and GOODS-North. The average 1σ depth of S2CLS is 1.2 mJy beam−1, approaching the SCUBA-2 850 μm confusion limit, which we determine to be σc ≈ 0.8 mJy beam−1. We measure the 850 μm number counts, reducing the Poisson errors on the differential counts to approximately 4 per cent at S850 ≈ 3 mJy. With several independent fields, we investigate field-to-field variance, finding that the number counts on 0.5°–1° scales are generally within 50 per cent of the S2CLS mean for S850 > 3 mJy, with scatter consistent with the Poisson and estimated cosmic variance uncertainties, although there is a marginal (2σ) density enhancement in GOODS-North. The observed counts are in reasonable agreement with recent phenomenological and semi-analytic models, although determining the shape of the faint-end slope (S850 < 3 mJy) remains a key test. The large solid angle of S2CLS allows us to measure the bright-end counts: at S850 > 10 mJy there are approximately 10 sources per square degree, and we detect the distinctive up-turn in the number counts indicative of the detection of local sources of 850 μm emission, and strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. All calibrated maps and the catalogue are made publicly available.},

  abstract = {We have obtained spectroscopic redshifts using the Keck I telescope for a sample of 73 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), with a median 850 μm flux density of 5.7 mJy, for which precise positions are available through their faint radio emission. The galaxies lie at redshifts out to z = 3.6, with a median redshift of 2.2 and an interquartile range z = 1.7-2.8. Modeling a purely submillimeter flux-limited sample, based on the expected selection function for our radio-identified sample, suggests a median redshift of 2.3, with a redshift distribution remarkably similar to the optically and radio-selected quasars. The observed redshift distributions are similar for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and starburst subsamples. The median RAB is 24.6 for the sample. However, the dust-corrected ultraviolet (UV) luminosities of the galaxies rarely hint at the huge bolometric luminosities indicated by their radio/submillimeter emission, with the effect that the true luminosity can be underestimated by a median factor of ~120 for SMGs with pure starburst spectra. Radio and submillimeter observations are thus essential to select the most luminous high-redshift galaxies. The 850 μm, radio, and redshift data are used to estimate the dust temperatures and characterize photometric redshifts. Using 450 μm measurements for a subset of our sample, we confirm that a median dust temperature of Td = 36 ± 7 K, derived on the assumption that the local far-infrared (FIR)-radio correlation applies at high redshift, is reasonable. Individual 450 μm detections are consistent with the local radio-FIR relation holding at z ~ 2. This median Td is lower than that estimated for similarly luminous IRAS 60 μm galaxies locally. We demonstrate that dust temperature variations make it impossible to estimate redshifts for individual SGMs to better than Δz ≃ 1 using simple long-wavelength photometric methods. We calculate total infrared and bolometric luminosities (the median infrared luminosity estimated from the radio is 8.5 × 1012 L☉), construct a luminosity function, and quantify the strong evolution of the submillimeter population across z = 0.5-3.5 relative to local IRAS galaxies. We use the bolometric luminosities and UV-spectral classifications to determine a lower limit to the AGN content of the population and measure directly the varying the contribution of highly obscured, luminous galaxies to the luminosity density history of the universe for the first time. We conclude that bright submillimeter galaxies contribute a comparable star formation density to Lyman break galaxies at z = 2-3, and including galaxies below our submillimeter flux limit, this population may be the dominant site of massive star formation at this epoch. The rapid evolution of SMGs and QSO populations contrasts with that seen in bolometrically lower luminosity galaxy samples selected in the rest-frame UV and suggests a close link between SMGs and the formation and evolution of the galactic halos that host QSOs.},
